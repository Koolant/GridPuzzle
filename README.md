# GridPuzzle

This is my solution to a challenge question. The challenge is as follows:

The program must read in input in the form of lines of '0's and '.'s one line at a time. For example one line of input might be "00.0..0". These lines are meant to be representative of either populated ('0') or empty ('.') cells in a grid. Each line read in represents a row in the grid.

After reading these lines the program must must output the coordinates of every populated cell, the first populated cell to its right along the x axis and the first populated cell below  it along the y axis. If no populated neighbor cells exist the program must output -1 -1 where that neighbors coordinates would be. The output must take the format of "x1 x2 y1 y2 z1 z2".
